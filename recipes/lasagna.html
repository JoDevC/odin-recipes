    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna, pasta dish of Italian origin, made with broad often ruffled noodles and a tomato or white sauce.
        Lasagna, in the singular, is a southern Italian variation of what northern Italians call lasagne, in the plural.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
                
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>

        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>

        <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>

        <li>a top down view of all ingredients to make lasagna gathered on a kitchen countertop.</li>
            
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            
        <li>ground beef browning in the bottom of a skillet. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            
        <li>crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, sugar and seasonings added to browned beef. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            
        <li>cooked lasagna noodles in a strainer. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            
        <li>ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt combined in a mixing bowl. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            
        <li>>more meat sauce and parmesan cheese layered on top of sliced mozzarella. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            
        <li>foil sprayed with cooking spray ready to cover lasagna. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
